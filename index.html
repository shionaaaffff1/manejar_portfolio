          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I’m a student, front-end developer, and lifelong learner passionate about building useful tools and sharing knowledge.
            This site is a hub for my work, experiences, and thoughts. Feel free to explore my projects, read my blog, or reach out via the contact page.

          <p>
            I'm currently a 3rd-year Information Technology student at Central Philippine University. My journey into tech started with a curiosity about how websites and apps work behind the scenes — what began as simple tinkering eventually became a serious passion for programming and problem-solving. Studying at CPU has helped me build a solid foundation in software development, database systems, and network technologies. Along the way, I’ve developed a growing interest in web development. Every project I take on is a chance to challenge myself and learn something new. I'm now focused on expanding my skills through hands-on experience and collaborative work that pushes me beyond the classroom.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m always open to new opportunities and collaborations. If you’d like to connect, please reach out through the contact page or find me on social media.
          </p>

            Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I enjoyed creating it.
